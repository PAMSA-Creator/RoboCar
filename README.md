## Welcome to GitHub RoboCar project pages

This is a robotics project run by members of the Parramatta MakerSpace Association (PAMSA).
The aim of this project is to build a small mobile robot for kids.
The robot can be remotely controlled or programmed to accomplish a number of tasks.
We are building this from scratch, learning as we go.
All project data files can be found on our Google Drive. This repo only contains the code that runs on our robot.

## Github Pages Instructions

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/PAMSA-Creator/RoboCar/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
