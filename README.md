## Welcome to GitHub RoboCar project pages

This is a robotics project run by members of the Parramatta MakerSpace Association (PAMSA).
The aim of this project is to build a small mobile robot for kids.
The robot can be remotely controlled or programmed to accomplish a number of tasks.
We are building this from scratch, learning as we go.
All project data files can be found on our Google Drive. This repo only contains the code that runs on our robot.

### Repo structure

All source code is contained in the src folder.
Configuration files for Visual Studio Code are found in the .vscode folder

### Visual Studio Code configuration

If used, Visual Studio Code should be pre-configured to generate and run code for Arduino.
It means that the Arduino IDE should be installed and all necessary VSC extensions installed:
- Arduino
- C/C++
- C++ Intellisense
VSC natively handles GitHub commands but requires a third party tool to do so. Git GUI will be required to allow VSC to provide Source Control functionality GitHub style.

If necessary, locally update the c_cpp_properties.json file to suit your environment.

## Github Pages Instructions

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/PAMSA-Creator/RoboCar/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/PAMSA-Creator/RoboCar/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
